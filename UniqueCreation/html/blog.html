								An image for an artist is a way to depict his/her inner feelings,which helps to express all sort of emotions.In my opinion a fine artist is the one who has the power to change one kind of emotion to other.For an artist passion towards color balance is very important...
								My soul gets attracted towards the #dark art potrait.I feel like it has some kind of hidden secrets which infact is hard to reveal...Even then the secrets differ from person to person...
								There are few images which seems to have distinct feelings,emotions,expressions based on the perspective of the viewer......

						KGF, the tittle was born in two years ago,but in late 2018,a kind of revolution has begun in kannada industry.
						I feel like it started to reach the peak of mount everest,the way its reaching out there is remarkable(the sign which is impossible to erase)
						After surffing all the reviews about the film from different regions, yesterday (24-12-218) i had been to watch this masterpiece.
						The cinematography(Bhuvan Gowda) has reached the heights of excellence. The color of fire(Agni) brought in each frame was brilliant.I was astonished to watch the theme.The angle of camera, light effects. . Everything was blended perfectly to give an ultimate output.Over all it is history in kannada industry.Its like "2018 is not like 2018"

						Bruce Lee, figuring out how his mind was syncing with his fight.When I heard about the Bruce Lee who was the legend of Martial Arts and the founder of Jeet Kune Do ,as well as one of the sincere student of the master the IP Man from my father,some kind of sensational waves surrounded me,to know everything about him.I have never thought of becoming fan of him,which indeed a great pleasure to me.

						My father always used to say he had the shape of the body which resembles lion,internally feels me he was the king of Martial Arts.I know in this beautiful,yet competition world,everyone has the desire to have name and fame,and our mind functionality is built in such a way that ,we want everything to happen as soon as possible,which can be controlled by meditation.

						When Bruce Lee had begun to take the training of Martial arts,the Wing Chun one of the famous fight style,he had just thought of it as a fight against the opponent.As he said follow the opponent flow until he finish and succeed by finishing his incomplete movement.This is the way we need to succeed by forcing him to defeat by himself.

						As we know we get more and more knowledge by the key of experience(time), Bruce Lee had been realized that the intention of the Martial Arts is not a fight against the opponent,instead its actual essence is a war against our inner demons,fear.

						If we conquer our inner demons,fear then ultimate path we actually can see is peace of mind(success).I always wondered how Martial Arts can help us to defeat our inner demons,its a process of defeating fear by fearless.

						As Bruce Lee said "Empty your mind,be formless,shapeless like water.Now you put water in a cup it becomes the cup,you put water into a bottle it becomes the bottle,you put it in a teapot it becomes the teapot.Now water can flow or it can crash."
